        I am celebrating us all.

                                   “We all have a sphere of influence. 
                                    Each of us needs to find our own sources of courage 
                                    so that we can begin to speak. 
                                    There are many problems to address, 
                                    and we cannot avoid them indefinitely. 
                                    We cannot continue to be silent. 
                                    We must begin to speak, 
                                    knowing that words alone are insufficient. 
                                    But I have seen that meaningful dialogue 
                                    can lead to effective action. 
                                    Change is possible.”
