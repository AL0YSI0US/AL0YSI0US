            You were created for                                  Each of us needs to find our own sources of  
                                                                  courage so that we can begin to speak. 
                rare occasions                                    There are many problems to address, 
                                                                  and we cannot avoid them indefinitely. 
                change                                            We cannot continue to be silent. 
                    disappear                                     We must begin to speak,

               without regret.                                    But I have seen that meaningful dialogue 
                                                                  can lead to effective action.

       REN√âE ATER

IN MEMORIAM: I CAN'T BREATHE                                        SOURCE: https://www.reneeater.com/on-monuments-blog/tag/list+of+unarmed+black+people+killed+by+police
May 29, 2020

I am angry. I am anguished. I am heartbroken.

I am hallowed out.

I am sick and tired of police needlessly killing black and brown people. Some police still see black men as threats, to brutalize, to contain, to remand. 
They have stereotyped our grandfathers, fathers, husbands, sons, and nephews, as monsters, subject to violence and death. They have killed our grandmothers,
mothers, wives, daughters, and nieces. Every time I watch the video of George Floyd‚Äôs death, my heart weeps. Who in their right mind, kneels on another human‚Äôs 
neck and ignores desperate pleas of ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Breathe‚Äù? Where is the humanity of these white police officers? Policing should not be predicated on brutal force 
and a complete disdain for black life. White supremacy has no place in the criminal justice system, in government, in the White House, in the United States. 

                            Black lives matter every second, every minute, every hour, every day.

                                                       IN MEMORIAM                   
                                                     
                                                    The universe shrank 
                                                    when you went away.
                                                    Every time I thought your name,
                                                    stars fell upon me.

*************************************************

NOTE 
This memorial is in honor of those unarmed black and brown people killed by the police, sheriff deputies, and security guards. The list is organized by most recent incident of police brutality (David McAtee and George Perry Floyd) and then moves back in time. I have listed each person by their name; birth and death dates; the location of their death; the means of death, date of death, and name of the police department. 

I culled the names from a variety of online sources including Black Lives Matter‚Äôs protests; Wikipedia; Black Past; Dangerous Objects, a website run by Mercy Garriga, that investigates cases of excessive use of force and death by the police force; and Professors Cassandra Chaney and Ray V. Robertson‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúArmed and Dangerous? An Examination of Fatal Shootings of Unarmed Black People by Police.‚Äù I have included women from the #SaveHerName project because we often ignore the injustices and violence that black women experience from the police: police brutality is real for women as it is for men. 

At the age of twenty-four, a friend introduced me to the radical and astonishingly beautiful poetry and writing of Henry Dumas. His poetry serves as the epitaph for this memorial; Dumas is the last entry on this list, shot by New York City Transit Police on May 23, 1968.

‚Äî Ren√©e Ater, May 29, 2020

**Many thanks to Cecilia Wichmann and Mary Savig for their fact checking of this list, including adding birth dates from the Social Security Death Index and links to additional news stories.
